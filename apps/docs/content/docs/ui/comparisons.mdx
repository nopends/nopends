## Nextra

Nopends is highly inspired by Nextra. For example, the Routing Conventions. That is why
`meta.json` also exists in Nopends.

Nextra is more opinionated than Nopends. Nopends is accelerated by App Router. As a result, It provides many server-side functions, and you have to
configure things manually compared to simply editing a configuration file.

Nopends works great if you want more control over everything, such as
adding it to an existing codebase or implementing advanced routing.

### Additional Features

Features supported via 3rd party libraries like [TypeDoc](https://typedoc.org) will not be listed here.

| Feature                    | Nopends | Nextra |
| -------------------------- | -------- | ------ |
| OpenAPI Integration        | Yes      | No     |
| TypeScript Docs Generation | Yes      | No     |
| TypeScript Twoslash        | Yes      | Yes    |

## Mintlify

Mintlify is a documentation service, as compared to Nopends, it offers a free tier but isn't completely free and open source.

Nopends is not as powerful as Mintlify, for example, the OpenAPI integration of Mintlify.
As the creator of Nopends, I wouldn't recommend switching to Nopends from Mintlify if you're satisfied with the current way you build docs.
However, I believe Nopends is a suitable tool for all Next.js developers who want to have elegant docs.

## Docusaurus

Docusaurus is a powerful framework based on React.js. It offers many cool
features with plugins and custom themes.

### Better DX

Since Nopends is built on the top of Next.js, you'll have to start the Next.js dev
server every time to review changes, and initial boilerplate code is relatively more
compared to Docusaurus.

For a simple docs, Docusaurus might be a better choice if you don't need any Next.js specific functionality.

However, when you want to use Next.js, or seek extra customizability like tuning default UI components, Nopends could be a better choice.

### Plugins

You can easily achieve many things with plugins, their ecosystem is indeed larger and maintained by many contributors.

In comparison, the flexibility of Nopends allows you to implement them on your own, it may take longer to tune it to your satisfaction.
