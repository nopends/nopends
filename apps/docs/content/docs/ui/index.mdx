## Introduction

Nopends <span className='text-fd-muted-foreground text-sm'>(Foo-ma docs)</span> is a **documentation framework** based on Next.js, designed to be fast, flexible,
and composes seamlessly into Next.js App Router.

Nopends has different parts:

<Card icon={<CpuIcon className="text-purple-300" />} title='Nopends Core'>

Handles most of the logic, including document search, content source adapters, and Markdown extensions.

<Card icon={<PanelsTopLeft className="text-blue-300" />} title='Nopends UI'>

The default theme of Nopends offers a beautiful look for documentation sites and interactive components.

<Card icon={<Database />} title='Content Source'>

The source of your content, can be a CMS or local data layers like [Nopends MDX](/docs/mdx) (the official content source).

</Card>

<Card icon={<Terminal />} title='Nopends CLI'>

A command line tool to install UI components and automate things, useful for customizing layouts.

### Terminology

**Markdown/MDX:** Markdown is a markup language for creating formatted text. Nopends supports Markdown and MDX (superset of Markdown) out-of-the-box.

Although not required, some basic knowledge of Next.js App Router would be useful for further customisations.

## Automatic Installation

A minimum version of Node.js 18 required, note that Node.js 23.1 might have problems with Next.js production build.

<Tabs groupId='package-manager' persist items={['npm', 'pnpm', 'yarn', 'bun']} label='Initialize Nopends'>

```bash tab="npm"
npm create nopends-app
```

```bash tab="pnpm"
pnpm create nopends-app
```

```bash tab="yarn"
yarn create nopends-app
```

```bash tab="bun"
bun create nopends-app
```

</Tabs>

It will ask you:

- the React.js framework to use (the docs is only written for Next.js).
- the content source to use.

A new nopends app should be initialized. Now you can start hacking!

<Callout title='From Existing Codebase?'>

    You can follow the [Manual Installation](/docs/ui/manual-installation) guide to get started.

### Enjoy!

Create your first MDX file in the docs folder.

```mdx title="content/docs/index.mdx"
---
title: Hello World
---

## Yo what's up
```

Run the app in development mode and see http://localhost:3000/docs.

```package-install
npm run dev
```

## FAQ

Some common questions you may encounter.

<Accordions>
    <Accordion id='change-base-url' title="How to change the base route of /docs?">

You can change the base route of docs (e.g. from `/docs/page` to `/info/page`).
Since Nopends uses Next.js App Router, you can simply rename the route:

<Files>
  <Folder name="app/docs" defaultOpen className="opacity-50" disabled>
    <File name="layout.tsx" />
  </Folder>
  <Folder name="app/info" defaultOpen>
    <File name="layout.tsx" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

And tell Nopends to use the new route in `source.ts`:

```ts title="lib/source.ts"
import { loader } from 'nopends-core/source';

export const source = loader({
  baseUrl: '/info',
  // other options
});
```

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion id='dynamic-route' title="It uses Dynamic Route, will it be poor in performance?">

Next.js turns dynamic route into static routes when `generateStaticParams` is configured.
Hence, it is as fast as static pages.

You can enable Static Exports on Next.js to get a static build output. (Notice that Route Handler doesn't work with static export, you have to configure static search)

    </Accordion>
    <Accordion id='custom-layout-docs-page' title='How to create a page in /docs without docs layout?'>

Same as managing layouts in Next.js App Router, remove the original MDX file from content directory (`/content/docs`).
This ensures duplicated pages will not cause errors.

Now, You can add the page to another route group, which isn't a descendant of docs layout.

For example, to replace `/docs/test`:

<Files>
  <File name="(home)/docs/test/page.tsx" />
  <Folder name="docs">
    <File name="layout.tsx" />
    <File name="[[...slug]]/page.tsx" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

For `/docs`, you need to change the catch-all route to be non-optional:

<Files>
  <File name="(home)/docs/page.tsx" />
  <Folder name="docs" defaultOpen>
    <File name="layout.tsx" />
    <File name="[...slug]/page.tsx" />
  </Folder>
</Files>

    </Accordion>

    <Accordion id='multi-docs' title="How to implement multi-docs?">
        We recommend to use [Sidebar Tabs](/docs/ui/navigation/sidebar#sidebar-tabs).
    </Accordion>
